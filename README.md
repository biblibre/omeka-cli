## Installation

### Using composer

```sh
# For the latest released version
composer global require biblibre/omeka-cli:@alpha   # No stable releases yet!

# For the latest dev version
composer global require biblibre/omeka-cli:@dev
```

Then add `~/.config/composer/vendor/bin` to your `PATH`

```sh
export PATH=~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
```

### Using the phar

Download the latest Ì€`omeka-cli.phar` from [Releases] page.

```sh
wget https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-cli/releases/download/$VERSION/omeka-cli.phar
chmod +x omeka-cli.phar
sudo mv omeka-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/omeka-cli
```

### Using the sources

```sh
git clone https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-cli.git
cd omeka-cli
composer install --no-dev
bin/omeka-cli version
```

## Creating custom commands

To create a custom command named `bar` with the Foo plugin, put the
following code in the `initialize` hook of your plugin's main class:

```php
$events = Zend_EventManager_StaticEventManager::getInstance();
$events->attach('OmekaCli', 'commands', function() {
    return array(
        'Foo:Bar' => array(
            'class' => 'Foo_Bar',
            'aliases' => array('bar'),
        ),
    );
});
```

and define a class `Foo_Bar` which implements
[OmekaCli\Command\CommandInterface](src/Command/CommandInterface.php)

Then you will be able to run the command either this way:

```sh
omeka-cli Foo:Bar [OPTION...] [ARG...]
```

or using the alias:

```sh
omeka-cli bar [OPTION...] [ARG...]
```

To see how to create a custom command from a plugin in practice, see plugin
[Foo].

## Running tests

If you want to test `omeka-cli`, copy `phpunit.xml.dist` into `phpunit.xml` and
change environment variables `OMEKA_DB_*` as needed.
If you want to avoid downloading Omeka before every run, you can download the
ZIP file manually, and put its local path in `OMEKA_ZIP_PATH`.

After you've done that, run

```sh
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
